# nn.api
I am kind of frustrated and in a slump to how i want to interact with my neural net and luckily, i get to learn the wonders of API!

![API-1024x418](https://github.com/le-nicolas/nn.api/assets/112614851/65b02153-9f6a-4ad2-9d7a-ce2699598b63)

an API that serves a machine learning model, allowing users to submit data for predictions and retrieve results.

It turns out, its just simple if you know there is an another approach! :)
kind of excited and want to do this next!!!
